# story

Just a quick rundown of how we got here.

Used Unraid for years, but found dashboard cluttered.  Started
building a custom dashboard, but disliked the confines of Unraid.
Pivoted to an opinionated, full-stack solution heavily inspired by Unraid.

Because I've already got years in Unraid, I hope to build the client in a way
that it can be used alongside Unraid as much as possible.  I also prematurely posted a screen
shot of the project to r/unRaid that was well received, and it'd be a dick move to not
follow through.

# monetization

I won't lie, I'd love to monetize this in an appropriate way. 

won't happen
- Closing the source down in any way (ie, licensing restrictions/subscriptions) is out
of the question.
- support plans kind of go against the goal of a low-maintenance.  Kinda hard to justify charging for something you're touting as 'plug and play'
- joining an ad-network like Google

could happen
- donations/patreon/onlyfans
- pivot to blockchain tech and launch and ICO.

can happen
- sponsorships are cool, hit me up if you want to sponsor this project.
